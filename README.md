# Olivia-Final-Repository
## By Olivia Hogan

### Introduction
This repository consists of three projects I completed throughout my semester of Computational Physics at High Point University. This semester brought new challenages as well as new ideas. We worked on a range of projects and programs in order to build confidence in the field. The three projects I chose to display include, Gravitational Field on an Object in Space, Air Resistance Involved with a Homerun Hit, and the Development of Poincare Maps for a Model of a Damped Driven Pendulum. I've provided links below to each of the programs.

## Gravitational Field on an Object in Space

In this project, I worked with two objects in space. One was a long cylinder shape while the other was a small sphere. The gravitional field caused the sphere to orbit the cylinder. I found the velocity needed to keep the sphere in a circular orbit. This project challenged me by encorporating things I learned years before and having those concepts meet the concepts I was learning this semester. The entaglement of these ideas really brought the project together and made the simulation impressive.

## Air Resistance Involved with a Homerun

In this project, I investigated drag associated with hitting a baseball. I also went in and found the temperature and wind speed and direction that day in order to get the most accurate path for the baseball. When I found all the information, I graphed the path that the baseball took. This project was interesting to learn how the temperature will end up impacting the path due to its affects on air density. I enjoyed watching the graphs slightly change when I would change something like air density or wind direction.

## Poincare Map for Pendulum

In this project, I used our textbook, Computational Modeling and Visualization of Physical Systems with Python By J. Wang, to investigate how to make a Poincare Map. Poincare maps are great when looking at a periodic behavior so using it for the pendulum with a simple harmonic motion was a good project. After I had the original Poincare map set, I went on to investigate different intital conditions in order to see how it would impact the map.
