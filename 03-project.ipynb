    "# Unit 03 Project -- Chaos\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this \"mini project\" is to demonstrate that you can model a chaotic system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your project should:\n",
    "\n",
    "- clearly define the model that you are investigating.\n",
    "- use LaTeX to format mathematical equations in your narrative.\n",
    "- demonstrate properties of a chaotic system like period doubling, self-similarity, and sensitivity to initial conditions.\n",
    "- use plots to visualize the system, like a bifurcation diagram or a Poincare Map, for example.\n",
    "- calculate parameters associated with chaos like Lyapanov exponent and Feigenbaum number, $\\delta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-success\">\n",
    "The mini-project should be of sufficient quality to post to github in your portfolio of work that can be shown to a potential employer.\n",

    "Your notebook should have the following sections.\n",

    "### Purpose/Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly describe the purpose of the notebook. What are you modeling? What are you investigating? What did you find?\n",

    "### Code\n",
    "\n",
    "Do not describe your code, unless your description is important and useful to the reader.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "What leads you to believe your simulation correctly models the system?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Results/Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly describe your results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### References\n",
    "\n",
    "Cite your sources. If your program is largely based on another program, describe your unique contributions.\n",
